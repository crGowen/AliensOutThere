# AliensOutThere

Build with Unity 2018.3.1f1

Main menu not going to be featured (final build will be webapp)



# Controls:

R - reset view

Left click (on a civilisation in list) - look to civilisation

Left click and drag - rotate view

Scrollwheel - zoom in or out; alternate control - press Z / X

, / . - increase / decrease time warp

Space - change between civilisation/realistic view (the realistic view isn't yet implemented, but essentially replaces all stars with, well, things that look like actual stars (and the galactic nucleus will be visible in realistic view)

WASD - move camera manually

Q / E - roll view

Shift / Ctrl - hold to accelerate or fine control whilst pressing WASD/Q+E controls

# Still to be done:

Realistic view

Sounds

Star info panel

Optimisation and refactoring... there's a lot of this to be done, the code is written with most variables poorly name and set to public access (public access so they can be viewed in the Unity Editor)

# AliensOutThere

Build with Unity 2018.3.8f1

Open in Unity Editor, go to Assets > Scenes and open the Galaxy scene. Then set the display resolution to 720p or above at which scale fits your monitor.

# Controls:

R - reset view

Left click (on a civilisation in list) - look to civilisation

Left click and drag - rotate view

Scroll wheel - zoom in or out (does the same thing as W / S but scroll wheel has better control)

, / . - increase / decrease time warp

Space - change between civilisation/realistic view (the realistic view isn't yet implemented, but essentially replaces all stars with, well, things that look like actual stars (and the galactic nucleus will be visible in realistic view)

WASD - move camera manually

Q / E - roll view

Z / X - move view up and down

Shift / Ctrl - hold to accelerate or fine control whilst pressing WASD/Q+E controls

M - mute sounds

# Still to be done:

Optimisation and refactoring

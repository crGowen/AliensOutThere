# AliensOutThere

Build with Unity 2018.3.8f1

Open in Unity Editor, go to Assets > Scenes and open the Galaxy scene. Then set the display resolution to 1920x1080 at 1x scale (may need to define a custom resolution to do this).

Main menu not going to be featured (final build will be web app)



# Controls:

R - reset view

Left click (on a civilisation in list) - look to civilisation

Left click and drag - rotate view

Scroll wheel - zoom in or out (does the same thing as W / S but scroll wheel has better control)

, / . - increase / decrease time warp

Space - change between civilisation/realistic view (the realistic view isn't yet implemented, but essentially replaces all stars with, well, things that look like actual stars (and the galactic nucleus will be visible in realistic view)

WASD - move camera manually

Q / E - roll view

Z / X - move view up and down

Shift / Ctrl - hold to accelerate or fine control whilst pressing WASD/Q+E controls

# Still to be done:

Realistic view

Sounds

Star info panel

Optimisation and refactoring... there's a lot of this to be done, the code is written with most variables poorly name and set to public access (public access so they can be viewed in the Unity Editor)

# AliensOutThere

GIT IGNORES NOT YET CONFIGURED!!!

Build with Unity 2018.3.1f1

Main menu not yet created, so just test scenes inside Unity Editor only rather than building (otherwise you won't be able to exit)



Controls:

R - reset view

(click on a civilisation) - look to civilisation

scrollwheel - zoom in or out

, / . - increase / decrease time warp

Space - change between civilisation/realistic view (the realistic view isn't yet implemented, but essentially replaces all stars with, well, things that look like actual stars (and the galactic nucleus will be visible in realistic view)

WASD - move camera manually (not yet implemented)

Rightclick and drag - rotate camera manually
